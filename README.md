# SLAP2-Listener
 
### 1. Run Matlab/listener.m
### 2. Python/broadcast.py

Matlab script starts a server. Python connects to that server and it sends a True flag. Once matlab gets the message it prints client connected. 

## Warning:
This was tested with the client and server on the same computer. It may not if the client and server are on different computer. Not sure if the SLAP2 computer is configured to broadcast in the AIND network.
